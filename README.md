# Project Title
Password generator
 
 ## Description
 Passwords generators play a key role in user security. With such tools, users can create stronger passwords that provide greater security for a given type of access. In an ever-connected world where financial fraud and identity theft have become rampant, it is important that users protect their sensitive information from hackers and malwares. The goal of this project is to create a password generator that randomly generates password based on user-selected criteria. The method utilized in this project is not considered cryptographically secure, however, for the sake of practice, the use of Math.random in this project will suffice.

 ### Work done 
 - Created a function that requests password length from user (the user is restricted to 8-128 characters)
 - Created a function to request character type selection from the user (the user must select a character type)
 - Generated password based on user-selected criteria.
